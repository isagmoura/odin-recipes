    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Churrasco is the national barbecue of Brazil, where spit-roasting has been
      raised to the level of art. Think whole meal cooked on a rotisserie and
      don’t think of a barbecue season without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply defined, churrasco is a Brazilian mix grill with the meats cooked
      on a rotisserie. Some people believe that the word churrasco comes from
      Spanish, socarras, meaning to burn or singe. You know, the socarrat, that
      burnt crusty part on the bottom of a paella pan that everybody wants. So
      from socarrat to churrasco? Well, it’s an easy leap if you drink enough
      caipirinhas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It starts with a cut of beef you probably haven’t heard of. It’s called
      picanha in Brazilian and top capped sirloin in the U.S., and it’s actually
      the top piece of sirloin with this thick cap of fat. Next is a chicken
      that has been marinated in salt, pepper, and garlic with a squeeze of
      fresh lime juice. Mini bell peppers, sausages, and onion on skewers finish
      off the mixed grill.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make the marinade for the chicken: In a small mixing bowl, combine the
          garlic, cilantro or parsley, if using, lime juice, olive oil, and salt
          and pepper and whisk to mix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag and pour the
          marinade over them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours,
          turning the bag occasionally so the thighs marinate evenly.
        </li>
        <li>In the meantime, trim the sirloin cap of any silverskin.</li>
        <li>
          Slice it crosswise against the grain into 2-inch-wide pieces. Season
          generously on all sides with salt and pepper, then form into a “C”
          shape with the fat cap on the outside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skewer the pieces of meat through the bottom and top sides to maintain
          the “C” shape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skewer the kielbasa and the vegetables on separate skewers. Brush the
          onions on all sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade (discard the marinade) and
          pat dry with paper towels. Skewer the chicken thighs.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a Brazilian-style rotisserie, like a Carson, set it up
          according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build a wood or charcoal fire and preheat to medium-high (400
          degrees).
        </li>
        <li>
          Insert the skewers in the sockets, beef and kielbasa on the top row,
          chicken, onions, and peppers on the bottom row.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spit-roast until each is cooked to taste: about 35 to 40 minutes for
          the chicken and onions, 45 minutes for the beef, and 30 minutes for
          the peppers and kielbasa.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotate the skewers every 10 minutes or so (or as needed) so each
          ingredient spends some time close to the coals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the chicken through (to an internal temperature of 165 degrees).
          Serve the beef crusty on the outside and medium-rare (130 to 135
          degrees) inside.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the meats with the salsa.</li>
