    <div>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat half the oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken pieces over a medium high heat, 
        stirring frequently, until golden brown.</li> 
        
        <li>Season and transfer to a plate.</li> 
        
        <li>Heat the remaining oil and lower the heat to medium. 
        Fry the onion for 6-8 mins until softened 
        but not golden, then stir in the garlic and paprika.</li> 
            
            <li>Fry for a minute until fragrant, then pour in the stock, 
            and add the Dijon and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
           
            <li>Tip in the seared chicken with any resting juices, 
            and simmer for 5-6 mins until reduced slightly and the chicken is cooked through.</li>  
        
        <li>Over a low heat, 
        stir in the soured cream until just combined to create a creamy sauce, 
        and it’s just started to simmer. </li>
        
       <li>Scatter over the parsley and serve with rice, 
        mash or pasta, if you like.</li>
